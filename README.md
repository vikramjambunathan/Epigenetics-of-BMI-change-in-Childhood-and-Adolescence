The motivation of this analysis is to analyze ALSPAC data, to run an EWAS at 9 timepoints to find out if there is any association between DNA methylation and body mass index (BMI) change during childhood and adolescence.  This project will aim to combine longitudinal data analysis approaches with standard EWAS methods to find whether including repeated measures of BMI reveals more epigenetic signatures  First step is modelling BMI over age in a group of up to 14,000 children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) and then perform a standard EWAS of BMI at each timepoint.  We will be using the package called CpGassoc to run the EWAS analysis.
